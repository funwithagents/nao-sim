# Our modules load from NAOqi's autoload, in place of the built-ins

**Status:** Done

Implements [service-replacement.md](../specs/container/service-replacement.md) ("Loading a module", "Replacing a built-in") and [container.md](../specs/container/container.md) ("The native build", "Entrypoint", "Matching a NAO's modules"). Our modules stop replacing the built-ins after the fact (let them load, `exit()` them, load ours over `ALLauncher`, relaunch or restart every module that held a proxy to them): the entrypoint starts NAOqi from an autoload copy where the built-ins' entries are left out and ours sit right after `pythonbridge`, with a new C++ loader module loading our Python modules at that point. Everything NAOqi loads afterwards finds our modules in place. Investigated in `spike/RESULTS.md` ("Loading from autoload instead of exiting the built-ins"). It leaves the modules themselves (cores, fronts, relay) unchanged.

## Scope

- `docker/naoqi/services/service-replacement/naoqi_sim_loader.cpp` — new: `_NaoqiSimLoader`, a C++ `ALModule` whose `init()` adds `NAOQI_SIM_MODULES_DIR` to the embedded interpreter's `sys.path` and `launchPythonModule`s each of `NAOQI_SIM_PYTHON_MODULES`, in order
- `docker/naoqi/Dockerfile.naoqi-2.1`, `docker/naoqi/Dockerfile.naoqi-2.8` — our `.so` files go to `/opt/naoqi/lib/naoqi/` (the suite's module folder), not `/opt/naoqi/lib/naoqi-sim/`; the native stage already compiles every `services/*/*.cpp`
- `docker/naoqi/entrypoint-lib.sh` — `write_autoload` (leave entries out, insert entries after others, fail when the suite's file lacks one); `exit_builtins`, `load_modules`, `load_native`, `launch_local`, `autoload_without` removed; `check_answer` also checks the added built-ins
- `docker/naoqi/entrypoint-2.1.sh`, `docker/naoqi/entrypoint-2.8.sh` — the new constants (`LEFT_OUT`, `OURS`, `MODULES`, `REPLACED`, `ADDED`, 2.1's added built-ins and `BUILTINS`, `LAST`) and sequence: write the copy, start, wait, check, ready
- `tests/test_entrypoint.py` — the fake `qicli` serves names as the autoload registered them (no launches to simulate); the sequence per version (no calls but `setReady`, the autoload copy, the exported variables); the failure checks (a replaced, added or added built-in name missing; `ALPythonBridge` or a last service never appearing; `naoqi-bin` exiting; the status module missing)
- `AGENTS.md` — the project map's `docker/` row names the `service-replacement/` folder
- The specs above, `Updated` until this plan is `Done`

## Steps

1. The loader, from the spike's, with the module list and the modules folder from the environment; compiled in both images by the existing native stage.
2. The Dockerfiles install the `.so` files in `/opt/naoqi/lib/naoqi/`.
3. `entrypoint-lib.sh`: `write_autoload <left out entries> <anchor>:<entry>,<entry>...`; remove the launch and exit helpers.
4. Both entrypoints: constants and sequence of container.md, "Entrypoint".
5. `tests/test_entrypoint.py` rewritten for the new sequence; the fast tier passes.
6. Rebuild both images (the live tier does it) and run the whole live tier on both versions; the dialog test (plan 202610132100's `test_sound_live.py`) on 2.8 and the preloaded behaviors' Play Sound on 2.1 (`test_an_installed_behavior_plays_its_sound`) must pass. Time a start of each version, cold (right after the rebuild) and warm.

## Result (Oct 14, 2026)

- Fast tier: `tests/test_entrypoint.py` rewritten (27 tests), 298 passed.
- Live tier, both images rebuilt, both versions: 180 passed, 11 skipped, 1 expected failure (2.8 Sit); the 28 failures are plan 202610132100's known gaps (LEDs, speaker volume, recording, body id, motion checks, 2.8's joint temperatures), 14 per version, as before this plan. `test_a_dialog_topic_answers_aloud` passes on 2.8 and `test_an_installed_behavior_plays_its_sound` on 2.1, with nothing restarted. The first boot of each version right after its image rebuild (cold cache) passed.
- Starts (`NaoqiSim.start()`, headless, no viewer): 2.8 about 18 s, against 35 s with the seven restarted services; 2.1 about 18 s. In the live tier, `test_packages_survive_a_restart` went from 30 to 20 s, `test_naoqi_sim_run_end_to_end` from 60 to 40 s, and the whole tier took 778 s for 220 tests (before: 621 s for 122, plus 253 s for plan 202610132100's 98).

## Verification

`uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format .`, `uv run pyright`, `uv run pytest`, `uv run pytest tests-e2e` on both versions. Then the specs go back to `Implemented` and this plan to `Done`.
