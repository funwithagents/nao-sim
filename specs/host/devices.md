# Host devices

**Status:** Draft

## Purpose

The simulated robot's inputs and outputs, on the host. A NAO has a loudspeaker, microphones, cameras and touch sensors; inside Docker, NAOqi has none of these, so nao-sim provides them on the host as **devices**: dumb, each doing one job, knowing nothing about NAOqi's tags, events or `say()` semantics. Every NAOqi-specific decision stays in the containers (the services of [services/](../services/)) or, for the devices that are ordinary qi clients, at the edge of the device.

Each device is named after its role on the robot, not after what implements it: the audio output may be a loudspeaker, a WAV file or memory, the video input a webcam or a render.

| Device | Spec | Direction | Talks to NAOqi through | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Audio output | [audio-output.md](audio-output.md) | The robot's voice and sounds, out | Its own TCP protocol, fed by the `tts` engine and later [`ALAudioPlayer`](../services/audio-player.md) | Built, with its audio sinks |
| Audio input | [audio-input.md](audio-input.md) | Microphone or WAV replay, in | The host link, into the [`ALAudioDevice`](../services/audio-device.md) replacement | Planned |
| Video input | [video-input.md](video-input.md) | Head cameras (nao-viewer render or webcam), in | qi: `ALVideoDevice.putImage` | Planned |
| Touch input | [touch-input.md](touch-input.md) | Head, hand, foot and chest sensors, in | qi: ALMemory | Planned |

This spec holds what every device shares: the contract below and the host link. The simulated world ([viewer.md](viewer.md)) is not a device, but it lives on the host too: the video input's render source and the touch input's clicks come from it.

## Decided

### The device contract

- **Owned by `NaoSim`.** A running `NaoSim` ([api.md](../runtime/api.md)) starts each device the config asks for (step 2 for the audio output, step 5 for the inputs of "Lifecycle"), in its own process, and stops them in reverse order. A device is never a user command: the only standalone entry point is a debugging one ([audio-output.md](audio-output.md), "Command").
- **Configured by its block** of [config.md](../runtime/config.md), named like the device: `audio_output`, `audio_input`, `video_input`. A device whose block says `none` is not started.
- **Pluggable at its edge.** Where the data goes or comes from is a seam, chosen by the config or passed in code: the audio output's `AudioSink`, the audio input's source (WAV file or host microphone), the video input's source (render or webcam). Tests plug in-memory ends.
- **Testable in CI first.** A runner has no loudspeaker, microphone or webcam, so each device is built with the end CI can use before the one that captures the user: memory and silent sinks for the audio output, the WAV source for the audio input, the render source for the video input ([ci.md](../testing/ci.md)).
- **Publishes its source.** An input device writes its `NaoSim/*/Source` key when it starts ([status-service.md](../container/status-service.md), "ALMemory keys"), as an ordinary qi client, and writes `none` back when it stops (best effort: NAOqi may be stopping too).
- **Real time.** A device paces its data in real time whatever its seam, so NAOqi's timing (a blocking `say()`, a microphone chunk cadence, a camera frame rate) is the same with a device, a file or memory.
- **Off unless asked** for the devices that capture the user: the webcam and the microphone run only when the config enables them, with an indicator in the sim window (or the terminal when headless) while live.
- **Over qi when qi suffices.** A device whose NAOqi side is a public API (`putImage`, ALMemory) calls it as an ordinary qi client, with the connect retry libqi 3 needs against 2.1. Only what qi cannot carry goes over the host link below.

### The host link

The containers and the host devices exchange what qi cannot carry over one TCP port. As designed, that is the audio input alone: the video and touch inputs are qi clients, the audio output keeps its own protocol ([audio-output.md](audio-output.md)), and the microphone gate runs on the host ([audio-input.md](audio-input.md), "Microphone gate").

- **The containers connect out** to the host at `host.docker.internal:9563` (`host-gateway` on Linux, as the `tts` container reaches the audio output on 9562), so only 9559 is published and the host never needs a container's address.
- **The host listens first.** `NaoSim.start()` opens the port at step 2, with the audio output, before the containers start; step 1 checks it is free with the other ports. A container side still retries every second while the host is absent, so a stack started by hand with `docker compose` connects whenever the host side comes up.
- **One connection per container-side service.** Each service that needs the host (today only `ALAudioDevice`) opens its own connection and sends a `hello` naming itself first; a second `hello` for the same service replaces the older connection.
- **Framing**, the toolkit's shared convention (nao-viewer's protocol): `u32 header_len | u32 payload_len | JSON header | raw payload`, big-endian. Every header has a `type`; the device spec owns its types (the audio input's in [audio-input.md](audio-input.md), "On the host link").
- **No state survives a reconnect.** After a reconnect the container side sends its current state again (the audio input's subscription), so neither side needs to remember the other.

## Open questions

1. **The audio output on the link.** Whether the audio output moves onto the host link is for [audio-player.md](../services/audio-player.md) to decide: mixing speech and sound files may need one connection that carries several streams, which the per-stream protocol does not.
2. **Ports.** 9559, 9562 and 9563 are fixed, so one nao-sim runs per machine. Configurable ports come with several instances ([config.md](../runtime/config.md), open questions).
3. **Link latency.** How long a chunk takes from the host to a subscriber's `processRemote`, under the amd64 emulation of Apple Silicon included, is to measure when the audio input is built.
