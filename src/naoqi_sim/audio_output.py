"""The audio output: the simulated robot's loudspeakers on the host, a dumb PCM player and mixer
the containers stream into, as a NAO's sound server (specs/host/audio-output.md).

Protocol (TCP, one command per connection): a JSON header line, then a body.
  {"cmd": "play", "stream": "speech", "rate": 22050, "channels": 1, "format": "s16le",
   "volume": 1.0, "pan": 0.0}, then raw PCM until the sender closes; the connection is closed
   when the stream has played, was stopped, or a newer play of the same name started.
  {"cmd": "stop", "stream": "speech"} stops that stream; without "stream", every stream.
  {"cmd": "set", "stream": ..., "volume": ..., "pan": ...} changes a playing stream.
  {"cmd": "pause" | "resume", "stream": ...} holds a stream, or lets it go on.
Streams of different names play together: a mixer sums them at the loudspeakers' format (48 kHz
stereo) in 20 ms ticks, paced in real time, and feeds the mix to an `AudioSink` (the output
device, nothing, a WAV file or memory) and to the listeners. A running `NaoqiSim` owns it; there is
no command to start it on its own.
