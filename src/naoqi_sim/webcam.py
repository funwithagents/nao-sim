`cv2` comes with the `naoqi-sim[webcam]` extra and is imported only when a camera's source is
`webcam`. A `Webcam` reads its camera on a thread of its own and keeps the newest frame; the video
input takes it at its camera's `fps`, centre-cropped to the NAO camera's 4:3, scaled to VGA and
converted to RGB. A camera that stops delivering is logged once and reopened every few seconds:
the robot never stops on a camera problem.
